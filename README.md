## 1. The App
I decided to step out of my comfort zone and build an Android mobile app instead of building the solution as a website. 

 - The app takes any valid number and formats it into the requested money format.
 - If the value provided is invalid (e.g. any ASCII characters) it shows an error message.
 - The app runs on any Android device/emulator from Android 4.x and above.

[TODO] add video/gif of the app in action here.

## 2. Unit testing
Testing on a lower level of the app to make sure that certain functionalities are working as expected. Testing on a unit testing level is always favoured over UI testing as it is faster to build and execute and also less expensive in resources (time/money).

Using Junit 5.x

### Test cases:
| Test case             | Description       |
| -----------           | -----------       |
| Integers              |                   |
| Float values          |                   |
| Double values         |                   |

#### 2.1 How to run it?

## 3. UI testing
UI testing is still needed to ensure that certain parts of the app are functioning as expected (e.g. showing error messages). For this, I created two testing techniques, one is black-box and the other is white-box to showcase 

### 3.1 Espresso tests
White-box testing of the app.

### 3.2 Appium tests
Black-box testing of the app.
